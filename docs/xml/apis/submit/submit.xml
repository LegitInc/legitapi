    <Description>
        The submit methods allow Legit partners to send data to Legit. This data is aggregated, analyzed,
        and made available via the the query methods. Each submit method requires a set of identifiers to be
        passed in so a user can be correlated across organizations. The more identifiers that can be provided for 
        a user the more easily that user can be connected with users in other systems. As such, always provide
        as much identifying information for a user as is available.
