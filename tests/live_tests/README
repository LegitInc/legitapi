These tests shouldn't harm the live database. The app SHOULD be configured
to ignore data submitted by these tests.

STILL, to avoid impacting the live app, the procedure for testing the live environment is:
1. Deploy a NEW VERSION of the app
2. Run live tests against this NEW VERSION
3. Clear out any data created by the tests
4. Change the default version of the app to the NEW VERSION
